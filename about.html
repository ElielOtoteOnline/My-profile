      <p>The name Eliel Otote A, whether as an Actor, Writer, Producer or Presenter, is not strange to a generation of ardent television and radio audiences across Nigeria, from the early 80's in programmes like VARIETY TIME, RECORDS REVIEW on radio; and on the television, ASSIZES, YOUTH RENDEZVOUS, SUPER MOVIES, TALES BY MOONLIGHT, TELEMOVIES, etc. And with the advent of the Nollywood brand, Eliel became an instant crossover Actor, Scriptwriter and Director. This humble Filmmaker with the unique "T" shape-moustach and pink lips was among the few practitioners who brought their wealth of TV experiences into the emerging Nollywood.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Though, better known today as an Actor who breathes life into any characters he plays, as he is currently doing with the character-MR. DEPUTY on The Johnsons, Eliel has also written numerous hit movies among which are TO RISE AGAIN, TWO GOOD FRIENDS, VIRGIN PROSTITUTE, DR. DAMIAN,  MISSING ANGELS 1, RAZOR BLADE, etc. His written and directed controversial movie for Abog Communications, WHO KILLED DELE, got a nomination at the 2nd National Film Festival in 2004, now the ZUMA Film Festival. And his coproduced documentary, DESERT GOLD, won the Best Agricultural film of that year, at the same festival.</p>
      <br>

<p>Besides doing his best at entertaining people, Eliel is training Actors, Writers and Directors for the future of Nollywood. He designs curriculum for many training facilities in the industry, that tap into his years of experience as a Trainer. He was one of the few Trainers recruited to train the Ex- Militants during the Federal Government Amnesty Programme. 

As part of his building blocks for the future of Nollywood, Eliel published the books: GETTING INTO NOLLYWOOD PROFESSIONALLY: THE ACTOR'S COMPANION, NO BABY FOOD, among others. (https://www.amazon.com/author/elielototea)
